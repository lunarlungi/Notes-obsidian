	  Women and non propertied men organised moments demanding equal political rights

	# in economic sphere
			in economic sphere liberalism stood for the freedom of markets and abolition of state imposed restrion on movement of goods and capital
		for example in german speaking regions due to napoleans administrative measures  it create 39 small confederations and each had its own currency weights and measures
		if a merchant wants to travell from hamburg to nuremburg he has to travell through 11 custom barriers and has to pay 5% tax in each barrier,duties were often calculated by weights and measure but at that time each state had different measures of cloth.'Elle' the measure of cloth stood for different measurements in different states
		these were viewd as obstacles for economic exchange. A custom union named as zollverein was formed by the initiative of Prussia in 1834. This union abolished tariff barriers and reduced the number of currencies from over 30 to 2
		The creation of railway networks further stimulated mobility
