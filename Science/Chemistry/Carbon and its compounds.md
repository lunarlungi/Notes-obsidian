CARBON AND ITS COMPOUNDS

Most carbon compounds are poor conductor of heat and electricity:

·         It forms covalent bond which has low force of attraction than ionic bond

·         These compounds are largely non-conductors, which doesn’t produce any ions

Reactivity:

It is the element’s tendency to react with other elements to fill the outer shell, i.e. to attain noble gas configuration.

Carbon doesn’t form ionic compounds because:

1.       If it were to gain 4 electrons to form C-4, then it will be difficult for the nucleus with 6 protons to hold 10 electrons that is 4 extra electrons

2.       If it were to lose 4 electrons to form C+4, it requires large amount of energy and even if it had lost 4 electrons it would leave a nucleus with 6 protons to hold only 2 electrons

To overcome these problems carbon uses covalent bonding

In this type of bonding it shares the electrons with other elements. This type of bonding is not just used by carbon but a variety of other elements like nitrogen oxygen etc.

Allotropes of Carbon:  Carbon can have many forms, with varying physical properties but have similar chemical properties

Eg :

Diamond:

·         Strongest and hardest substance known

·         Has high melting and boiling point

·         Doesn’t conduct electricity

·         Insoluble in water

Graphite:

·         It is smooth and slippery

·         Good conductor of heat and electricity

Buckminster fullerene:

·         Known as C-60

·         It has a geodesic dome design

·         Found by Buckminster fuller

Versatile Nature of Carbon:

·         Catenation: Carbon has a unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon giving rise to larger compounds, it can form any number of bonds with other carbon atoms. In addition to these it can form single double or triple bonds.

No other element other than carbon has the property of catenation to the extent of carbon. Silicon reacts with hydrogen to form chains up to 7 or 8 atoms

But carbon can form many number of bonds

·         Bonds made by carbon are very strong, as they are smaller in size they fit in gaps between the atoms which improves the force of attraction between bonds. Bonds formed by bigger atoms are much weaker
