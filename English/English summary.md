Sermon at Benares:

	==Early life of Buddha:==
		
		Gautama Buddha began his life as a prince as Siddhartha Gautama in northern India.At twelve, he was sent to schooling in Hindu sacred scriptures. After 4 years he returned for marrying a princess. They had a son and live happily for 10 years as a befitted royalty. At the age of 25, he who was shielded from the sufferings of the world got a glimpse of the real world. While out hunting he saw sick man, an aged man, a funeral procession and a monk begging for alms. These sights made him to go out to seek enlightenment. He wandered for seven years and finally sat under a Peepal tree where to vowed to stay until enlightenment came. Enlightened after 7 days, he renamed the tree as ‘Bodhi tree (the tree of wisdom)’ .at that point he began to teach and share his new understandings to others. Later he was known as Buddha.

	==Story of Kisa Gomati:==

	                Kisa Gomati had aa only son who had died, in her grief she carried the dead child to all the neighbours asking for the medicine to cure him. She went and asked to many people and finally she met a man who replied to her request. He replied that he doesn’t know the medicine for the child but knows a physician who can cure the child, and it was the Sakyamuni the Buddha

		When she cried to Buddha to give the medicine for the child, he replied that he wanted a handful of mustard seeds, and he added that it has to be collected from a house where no one of their beloved ones had died. Kisa went from house to house asking for the mustard seeds, many people gave her the seeds, but when she asked if any of their beloved ones had died, they replied that the living are few but the dead are many.

		She became weary and hopeless. She was sitting at the wayside when she saw the flickering lights of the city. They flickered up and they were extinguished again. That’s when she thought about the fate of men, their lives flicker up and would be extinguished.  

	==Teachings of Buddha:==

		As ripe fruits are early in the danger of falling so mortals are always in the danger of death. All earthen vessels made by the potter end up being broken so is the life of mortals. Both young and adult and both who are wise and fool all are subjected to death. No one could escape the power of death

		A father can’t save his son nor kinsmen their relation

		While relatives are looking on and lamenting one by one mortals are carried off like an ox to the slaughter.

		The world is afflicted by dead and decay, so the wise do not grieve.

		Dead are not saved by the arrow of lamentation complaint and grief. He who draws out the arrow of lamentation would obtain peace of mind.

Anne Gregory:

	The poem Anne Gregory talks about the inner beauty of a person. In this poem a young man is talking to Anne Gregory that, no young man should be thrown into despair by seeing those yellow color hairs she had and instead he should love her for herself and not her outer beauty.

	Anne replies that she could dye her hair to turn it black brown carrot so that they love her for herself and not her yellow hair.

	The young man also tells that he heard an old religious man tell him that only god is the one that loves you for your inner beauty and who you truly are and not for your external beauty

Fog

	In this poem the poet talks about the arrival of the fog. He says that it comes with its little cat feet. He compares fog with cat feet because it walks silently with its little cat feet and no one knows about its arrival. Similarly, the arrival of the fog is not noticed by anyone. It silently comes over forming thick clouds it spreads over the city and looks over the places just like the cat does. After sometime, the fog leaves the city and moves on. Here the poet wants to convey that the fog doesn’t stay there for a long time it disappears after some time like the cat. This fog is compared to the things that happen in our life. Both good things and bad things happen in our life and nothing is permanent. Everything is temporary

The Necklace

	                Matilda was one of those pretty young ladies, born as if through an error of destiny. She was born in a family of clerks. She had no dowry no hopes and no means for being known loved and married by a man who is rich and distinguished. She got married to a clerk in the board of education and though he is not rich in monetary means he was rich in values. She always thought about the luxurious life style she imagined like eating elegant dinner in silver utensils. She neither had frocks nor jewelery but those are the only things that she wants.

	One day her husband came to home with an envelope and gave it to her excitingly. It was an invitation for a grand ball party that happened in the minister’s residence. But this wasn’t exciting for her because she had nothing to wear for the ball. When her husband asked why she wasn’t excited she explained that she didn’t had anything to wear. After hearing this her husband was stupidified. When he asked for the cost of the dress she said it was 400 francs. Her husband gave her the money that he saved for buying a gun to go hunting with his friends

	The day of the ball arrived and her husband noticed that Matilda was sad for few days. When he asked about that she said that though she has a beautiful dress she did not have any jewelry to wear. Her husband gave her the idea to ask her friend Mme Forestier for some jewels. Hearing this Matilda agreed to ask her, her friend agreed to lend some jewels to her. After Matilda looked through all her collections she only chose one necklace with diamonds.

	On the day of the ball she was the prettiest of all, elegant beautiful. All men noticed her and asked her name. This was a victory for her that was so complete and sweet to her heart.

	After the ball they went home at 4 am in a coachman. At home she noticed that the chain was missing and louis who and work in morning and already half undressed dressed again and went to search the necklace. He returned at 7’o clock. He went to the police, cab office and also put up an advertisement that they would offer reward.

	Nothing helped and at the end of the week they lost all the hope and thought to replace the entire necklace with a similar one. In a shop named Palais-Royal they found a chaplet of diamonds that looked similar. It was 40000 francs and they could get it on about 36000 francs. Loisel already had 18000 francs that he inherited from his father and borrowed the remaining. They finally replaced the jewelry without her friend noticing.
